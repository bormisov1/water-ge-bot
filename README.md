* Allow bot user set his personal address string. The address string will be used to match events to notify user about. Events that have user's address as a substring in one of their addresses will be notified about to the user.
* Correctness of a specified address is checked upon recieval. The address is correct if it, trimmed, will be present as a substr in the list all addresses ever met on the scrapped website.
